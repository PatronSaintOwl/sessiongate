# Session Gate

Session Gate is a Redis module to ease session management.

## How it works

This module provides creation and administration of sessions using tokens. Each session can have more than one payload and those payloads can be accessed individually. A single instance of Redis loaded with this module can handle sessions from multiple applications.

Redis is a high performance, in-memory key/value database. This module is built on top of Redis, meaning this module operates in a very similar way Redis itself operates.

To access this module, any Redis compatible driver can be used. The commands to operate this module are exposed like any other Redis command.
